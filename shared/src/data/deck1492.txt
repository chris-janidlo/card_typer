Thou {two-faced:TwoFaced} {year:Year}, Mother of Change and Fate,
Didst weep when Spain cast forth with {flaming:Flaming} {sword:Sword},
The children of the {prophets:Prophet} of the Lord,
{Prince:Prince}, {priest:Priest}, and people, spurned by {zealot:Zealot} hate.
{Hounded:Hound} from sea to sea, from state to state,
The West {refused:Refuse} them, and the East {abhorred:Abhor}.
No {anchorage:Anchorage} the known world could afford,
Close-{locked:Lock} was every port, barred every gate.
Then smiling, thou {unveil'dst:Unveil}, O {two-faced:TwoFaced} year,
A virgin world where doors of {sunset:Sunset} part,
Saying, "Ho, all who {weary:Weary}, enter here!
There falls each {ancient:Ancient} {barrier:Barrier} that the art
Of race or creed or rank {devised:Devise}, to rear
{Grim:Grim} {bulwarked:Bulwark} hatred between {heart:Heart} and {heart:Heart}!"
