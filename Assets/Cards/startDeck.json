Alas, beside the fold\n\tA shepherd's pipe lies shattered near his sheep.\nLo! in the moonlight gleams a marble white,\n\tOn which I read: \"Here lieth one whose name\n\tWas writ in water.\" And was this the meed\nOf his sweet singing? Rather let me write:\n\t\"The smoking flax before it burst to flame\n\tWas quenched by death, and broken the bruised reed.\"",
